## Description
This is my automatic password bot 3000. It can be used to generate random passwords following certain criteria. 
It must contain 8 to 128 characters, and the user has the choice whether or not they want to include lower-
case characters, uppercase characters, numericals, or special characters. I made sure to include edge cases
around the parameters as to avoid having users input irrelevant information/information that cannot be used
for the purpose of this application. Deviations from the parameters will force the user to re-input a proper
value for both the number of characters and the case in which a user says "no" for all 4 possible characters.
The user must answer the parameter questions within the prompts and then click "generate password" afterwards.
